# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview of the starting conditions

Node Simple Server is a minimalistic vanilla Node.js TypeScript server for rapid prototyping. It provides:

- Static file serving from the `public` directory
- Persistent storage API through `/api/store/` endpoints
- External service proxy via `/api/proxy/` with environment variable interpolation
- Frontend example integrating with various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

## Commands

### Development

- **Start the server in development mode**: `npm run dev`
  - This loads environment variables from `.env` file

### Deployment

- **Deploy to Google Cloud Run**: `npm run deploy`
  - Creates/updates a Cloud Run service named after the project directory
  - Configures environment variables, secrets, and storage buckets
  - Uses Google Cloud's source-based deployment

- **Remove Cloud Run deployment**: `npm run undeploy`
  - Deletes the Cloud Run service

### Environment Setup

- **Initialize environment variables from 1Password**: `op inject -i example.env -o .env`
  - Required before first run

## Architecture

### Server (server.ts)

- HTTP server handling routes for static files, storage, and proxy requests
- Uses vanilla Node.js modules (http, fs, path, crypto) without external dependencies
- Environment variables:
  - `STORAGE_LOCATION`: Custom location for the storage file (default: `./storage`)
  - API keys and access permissions for proxy requests (see `example.env`)

### Storage

- Simple JSON-based persistence for storing arbitrary strings
- Uses MD5 hashing to generate URL-safe storage IDs
- File-based storage that can be backed by a mounted cloud bucket in production

### Proxy

- Forwards requests to external services with environment variable interpolation
- Security features:
  - Each environment variable requires a corresponding `*_ACCESS` variable
  - Allows whitelisting of specific hostnames for variable access

### Frontend (public/index.html, public/main.js)

- Simple demo integrating with multiple AI providers
- Uses Vercel AI SDK for streaming responses
- Supports sharing conversations via storage API
- Uses CDN-hosted libraries:
  - Vercel AI SDK and providers
  - Marked (Markdown parser)
  - Morphdom (DOM diffing)

## Development Flow

1. Initialize environment (requires 1Password): `op inject -i example.env -o .env`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Access the application at http://localhost:8080
4. Make changes to server.ts or public files
5. Restart the server to apply changes

## Deployment Flow

1. Create/update the Cloud Run service: `npm run deploy`
2. To remove the deployment: `npm run undeploy`

# Home Remodeling Visualization Tool

## Project Overview

This project is building an AI-powered tool that helps users visualize home remodeling with products they can actually purchase online. The system uses Gemini's vision AI to analyze a user's room photo, generate realistic visualizations of the remodeled space, and facilitate the purchase of those products.

## Core Requirements

- **CRITICAL**: Use ONLY the "gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation" model
- Focus on a conversational UI similar to the existing demo
- Include file upload for room photos
- Display both original room photo and progressively modified versions side-by-side
- Include brief instructions with example queries for room redecoration
- Handle transitions between stages conversationally, not with specific UI elements
- Implement simple error handling for cases when Gemini doesn't return images
- Store conversation and images in memory (no need for persistence)

## User Flow

1. **Photo Upload**: User uploads a photo of their room with optional notes about desired changes
2. **Initial Analysis**: Send to Gemini for analysis of the current room
3. **Visualization Creation**: Generate remodeled room with placeholder items
4. **Refinement Conversation**: Enable back-and-forth to modify room and placeholder products
5. **Product Matching**: Call external API (to be provided later) to find real products similar to placeholders
6. **Product Visualization**: Feed real product images back to Gemini to replace placeholders in the visualization
7. **Display Final Result**: Show the remodeled room with real products

## Technical Implementation

### UI Requirements

- Remove the provider selection dropdown - only use Gemini
- Display both original and current modified images side-by-side
- Include brief instructions with one example query
- Implement file upload component for room photos
- Error handling for when Gemini fails to return images

### Gemini Integration

```javascript
// Always use this specific model
const model = "gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation";

// Always include response_modalities for images
const config = {
  response_modalities: ['TEXT', 'IMAGE']
};
```

### Image Handling Flow

1. User uploads room photo
2. Store original photo in memory for reference
3. Send to Gemini with user's initial description of desired changes
4. Receive and display both text feedback and modified room image
5. Support continued conversation for refinements
6. When ready, transition to product matching (details to be implemented later)

### Error Handling

- Implement basic error messages if Gemini doesn't return images
- No need to handle file size limitations (under 20MB assumption)

## Implementation Notes

- The LLM will identify replaceable items based on conversation context
- Preference is to keep the UI simple initially, focusing on core functionality
- Start with in-memory storage of images and conversation history
- No need for special handling of the 20MB file size threshold

## Implementation Progress

### Current Status
We have successfully implemented:

1. A completely redesigned UI featuring:
   - Side-by-side display of original and modified room images
   - File upload functionality for room photos
   - Conversational interface for describing desired changes
   - Error handling and logging

2. Direct integration with Gemini's image generation model:
   - Successfully connected to the `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation` model
   - Built a secure API key handling system via a dedicated server endpoint
   - Implemented proper image encoding/decoding for API requests and responses

### Gemini Image Generation Integration Details

Working with the `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation` model required several specific configurations:

#### API Request Format
The correct format for image generation requests:
```javascript
{
  contents: [{
    parts: [
      // Add system prompt to the beginning of user message
      { text: systemPrompt + "\n\n" },
      // Include the image part
      { 
        inline_data: {
          mime_type: "image/jpeg", // or whatever the image format is
          data: base64EncodedImage 
        }
      },
      // User's query text
      { text: userQuery },
      // Explicit request for image in response
      { text: "\nPlease include an image in your response showing the remodeled room." }
    ],
    role: "user"  // Only 'user' and 'model' roles are supported
  }],
  generationConfig: {
    temperature: 0.4,
    topK: 32,
    topP: 0.95,
    responseModalities: ['TEXT', 'IMAGE']  // Must include both TEXT and IMAGE
  }
}
```

#### Key Requirements

1. **Role restrictions**: Only `user` and `model` roles are supported, not `system`. System prompts must be included in the user message.

2. **Response modalities**: Must explicitly request both `TEXT` and `IMAGE` in the response modalities.

3. **Direct image requests**: Include explicit instructions in the prompt to generate and include images.

4. **Image formatting**: Base64-encoded images must be properly formatted with correct MIME types.

5. **Response parsing**: Images are returned in the `inline_data` field of response parts, and must be properly extracted and decoded.

### Next Steps

The next phase will involve:

1. Continuing the conversational refinement process through multiple turns
2. Implementing the API integration to find real products matching the placeholders 
3. Feeding those product images back to Gemini to incorporate them into the visualization
4. Enabling the sharing and saving of final designs
