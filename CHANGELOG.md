## Update Log

### January 25, 2025 - LLM-Powered Brand Extraction and Legacy Code Cleanup

1. **Intelligent Brand Extraction System**:
   - **Function Parameter Approach**: Replaced complex separate LLM calls with elegant function parameter solution for brand extraction
   - **Enhanced findSimilarProducts Function**: Added `brand` parameter to function schema with clear extraction examples (Samsung, IKEA, West Elm, Herman Miller)
   - **Orchestrator Prompt Updates**: Added comprehensive brand extraction instructions and examples for accurate brand identification
   - **Single-Step Process**: Eliminated multi-step brand extraction in favor of LLM extracting brand as part of function execution

2. **Legacy Brand Detection Removal**:
   - **Eliminated extractCleanBrand() Function**: Removed entire function that contained problematic "first word as brand" logic and "ge" from commonBrands array
   - **Cleaned Up Fallback Logic**: Removed naive brand extraction that was causing "Using first word as brand: 'casa' from 'Casa Padrino luxury dining table'" logs
   - **Streamlined Code Path**: Removed all references to `cleanBrand`, `llmExtractedBrand`, and old brand detection variables
   - **Simplified Architecture**: Brand searches now use clean orchestrator approach without legacy fallback mechanisms

3. **Unknown Brand Handling**:
   - **Immediate Error Handling**: Added explicit check for `brand: "unknown"` to stop processing and ask user for help
   - **User-Friendly Messaging**: Returns "I'm sorry, but I can't figure out what brand this is. Can you help me out by telling me the brand name?" instead of attempting futile searches
   - **Efficient Resource Usage**: Prevents unnecessary API calls when brand cannot be identified

4. **Brand Search Flow Optimization**:
   - **Orchestrator Integration**: "More From This Brand" now uses orchestrator with brand parameter instruction instead of direct API calls
   - **Clean Function Handling**: `findSimilarProducts` handler properly processes brand parameter and routes to brand filtering system
